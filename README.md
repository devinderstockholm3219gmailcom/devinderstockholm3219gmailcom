## Hi there 👋


🌟 Devinder Singh — Fullstack Web Developer
Hi there! I’m Devinder, a curious and creative fullstack developer based in Finland, currently studying Fullstack Web Development at Chas Academy (Stockholm).
I love building interactive, expressive, and user‑friendly applications — especially those that combine React, TypeScript, and AI.  
My work blends clean architecture, modern UI, and practical problem‑solving.
